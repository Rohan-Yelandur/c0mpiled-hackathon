AUSTIN EMS ROUTING DATASET – COLUMN EXPLANATION

This dataset represents hospital infrastructure plus simulated real-time operational state for our EMS routing demo.

STATIC INFRASTRUCTURE FIELDS (REAL DATA)

These fields describe what the hospital is capable of.

hospital_name
Official hospital name.
Used for display and final routing output.

latitude
longitude
Geographic coordinates of the hospital.
Used to calculate distance and travel time from the scene.
Used in routing optimization.

total_staffed_beds
Total licensed/staffed inpatient beds.
Represents overall hospital size.
Acts as a general capacity proxy.
Higher number = larger facility.

trauma_level
Trauma designation (Level I–IV or None).
Level I = highest trauma capability
Level II = high trauma capability
Level III/IV = limited trauma services
None = not a trauma center

Used when patient requires trauma care.

stroke_center_level
Stroke capability designation.
Used when patient is suspected stroke.
Higher level stroke centers handle complex stroke cases (e.g., thrombectomy).

cardiac_cath_lab
Indicates whether hospital has cardiac catheterization lab.
Used when patient is suspected STEMI (heart attack).
If false, hospital cannot properly treat STEMI.

ESTIMATED STRUCTURAL CAPACITY (SEMI-REALISTIC PROXIES)

These represent estimated hospital service capacity.

ed_capacity_est
Estimated number of emergency department treatment spaces.
Used as maximum ER handling capacity.
Higher number = more patients can be processed simultaneously.

icu_capacity_est
Estimated number of ICU beds.
Used when patient requires ICU-level care.

SIMULATED LIVE STATE FIELDS (DYNAMIC – FOR DEMO)

These simulate real-time hospital status. These are not publicly available in real time and are intentionally simulated for the demo.

available_ed_beds_sim
Number of ED beds currently available.
Lower number = more crowded ER.
Used to penalize overloaded hospitals.

available_icu_beds_sim
Current ICU bed availability.
If 0, hospital cannot accept critical ICU patients.

er_wait_min_sim
Estimated ER wait time in minutes.
Represents congestion and ambulance offload delay.
Higher value = slower care.
Used directly in routing score.

ed_diversion_sim
Boolean (True/False).
If True, hospital is temporarily diverting ambulances.
Algorithm should exclude or heavily penalize this hospital.

on_call_ed_physicians_sim
Number of emergency physicians currently on duty.
Higher number = greater patient processing ability.
Used as staffing strength factor.

on_call_nurses_sim
Number of nurses currently on duty.
Impacts throughput and patient care capacity.

ambulance_travel_time_min_sim
Estimated travel time from scene to hospital (minutes).
Primary routing variable.
Shorter is usually better, unless hospital lacks capacity or capability.

HOW THESE VARIABLES FEED THE ALGORITHM

Step 1 – Hard Filters:
Remove hospitals on diversion.
Remove hospitals without required capability (trauma, stroke, cardiac, pediatric).
Remove hospitals with 0 ICU beds if patient is critical.

Step 2 – Score Remaining Hospitals:

Example scoring logic:

Score =
(travel_time_weight × ambulance_travel_time_min_sim)

(wait_weight × er_wait_min_sim)

(capacity_weight × available_ed_beds_sim)

(staff_weight × on_call_ed_physicians_sim)

(penalty_if_low_icu)

Lowest score = best hospital.
